# Net Practice

## Overview

This repository contains practice exercises and projects related to networking concepts, as part of the curriculum at 42 School. These exercises are designed to help students grasp various networking principles and protocols, enhancing their understanding and skills in this domain.

## Introduction to Networking
Networking is a foundational concept in the realm of computer science and technology. It revolves around the interconnection of devices and systems to share resources, information, and communication. In today's interconnected world, networking is crucial in enabling communication between computers, smartphones, servers, and other devices, both locally and globally.

At its core, networking involves exchanging data between devices over a communication medium, such as cables, wireless signals, or optical fibers. This exchange of data enables users to access websites, send emails, stream videos, transfer files, and perform countless other tasks that rely on network connectivity.

### Key Components of Networking:
1. **Devices**: Networking involves various types of devices, including computers, routers, switches, modems, access points, and servers. These devices serve different functions within a network and are interconnected to facilitate communication and data exchange.
2. **Protocols**: Protocols are rules and conventions that govern communication between devices on a network. They define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted by devices. Common network protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, DNS, and SMTP
3. **Topologies**: Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices and connections within a network. Common network topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh configurations, each with its advantages and limitations in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
4. **Addressing**: Network addressing involves assigning unique identifiers to devices on a network to facilitate communication. IP addresses are used to identify devices within a network, while MAC addresses are used to identify devices at the data link layer.
5. **Security**: Network security is a critical aspect of networking that involves protecting data, devices, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, attacks, and threats. Security measures include encryption, authentication, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols.

### Evolution of Networking:
Networking has evolved significantly over the years, driven by technological advancements and changing user demands. From early local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) to modern cloud computing and mobile networking technologies, the landscape of networking continues to evolve rapidly.

Emerging technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), 5G networking, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are reshaping the way networks are designed, deployed, and managed. These technologies offer new opportunities and challenges for businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to harness the power of network connectivity.

### Importance of Networking:
Networking is essential for businesses, organizations, and individuals alike, enabling collaboration, innovation, and connectivity on a global scale. It facilitates access to information, resources, and services, driving productivity, efficiency, and growth in various industries and sectors.

In the digital age, networking has become synonymous with communication, collaboration, and connectivity. Whether it's connecting people through social media, enabling remote work and learning, or powering e-commerce and online services, networking is the backbone of our interconnected world.

## Network Basics
Networking encompasses a wide range of concepts and principles that form the foundation of communication and data exchange in computer networks.

### 1. Networking Models (OSI, TCP/IP):
- **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**: The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose, such as physical transmission, data link connection, network addressing, and application services. The OSI model provides a structured approach to understanding and implementing network protocols and services.

- **TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model, commonly used in modern networking environments, especially on the internet. It consists of four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. The TCP/IP model defines the protocols and services used for communication between devices on the internet, including IP addressing, routing, TCP, UDP, and application-layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS.

### 2. Data Transmission
- **Analog vs. Digital**: Data transmission can occur in analog or digital formats. Analog transmission involves continuous signals that vary in amplitude or frequency, while digital transmission involves discrete signals represented as binary digits (0s and 1s).

- **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth refers to the maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection, typically measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), or megabits per second (Mbps). Higher bandwidth allows for faster data transmission.
- **Latency**: Latency, also known as delay, is the time it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination over a network. Latency can be affected by factors such as network congestion, distance, and processing time.
